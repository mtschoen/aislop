# Installation

The same CLI is published to npm, Homebrew, and PyPI. Pick whichever fits your stack — every channel installs the identical `aislop` and `aislop-mcp` commands.

| Channel | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| npm / npx | `npx aislop@latest scan` | No install; bundles its own tooling |
| Homebrew | `brew install scanaislop/tap/aislop` | macOS / Linux; pulls Node as a dependency |
| Python / pipx | `pipx install aislop` | Isolated env; needs Node on `PATH` |

## Run without installing

```bash
npx aislop scan
```

## Install as a dev dependency

```bash
# npm
npm install --save-dev aislop

# yarn
yarn add --dev aislop

# pnpm
pnpm add -D aislop
```

## Global install

```bash
npm install -g aislop
aislop scan
```

## Install from GitHub Packages

The package is also published as `@scanaislop/aislop` on GitHub Packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @scanaislop/aislop --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Install with Homebrew

macOS and Linux, via the official tap:

```bash
brew install scanaislop/tap/aislop
```

Equivalent two-step form:

```bash
brew tap scanaislop/tap
brew install aislop
```

Homebrew installs Node.js as a runtime dependency if it isn't already present. Upgrade with `brew upgrade aislop`. More: [homebrew-tap](https://github.com/scanaislop/homebrew-tap).

## Install with pipx (Python)

For Python-tooling environments:

```bash
pipx install aislop
```

`pipx` keeps `aislop` in an isolated virtual environment. Plain `pip install --user aislop` also works. Both still require **Node.js** on `PATH`, since the engines run on Node. Upgrade with `pipx upgrade aislop`. More: [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/aislop/).

## Bundled tooling

`aislop` ships with Node-based tooling (oxlint, biome, knip) as package dependencies. On install it also downloads bundled binaries for **ruff** and **golangci-lint**.

To skip binary downloads:

```bash
AISLOP_SKIP_TOOL_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

## External tools

Some checks depend on tools already installed on your machine:

- `gofmt`, `govulncheck` (Go)
- `cargo`, `clippy` (Rust)
- `rubocop` (Ruby)
- `phpcs`, `php-cs-fixer` (PHP)

Run `aislop doctor` to see what is available on your system.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 20
