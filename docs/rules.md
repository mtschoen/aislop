# Rules Reference

`aislop` groups checks into six engines. Each engine runs in parallel for speed.

## Formatting

Enforces consistent formatting using the best tool for each language.

| Language | Tool |
|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | Biome |
| Python | ruff format |
| Go | gofmt |
| Rust | cargo fmt |
| Ruby | rubocop |
| PHP | php-cs-fixer |

## Linting

Catches bugs and bad practices.

| Language | Tool |
|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | oxlint (bundled, with React/Next.js awareness) |
| Expo / React Native | expo-doctor (project health, dependency checks) |
| Python | ruff |
| Go | golangci-lint |
| Rust | clippy |
| Ruby | rubocop |
| C# | Roslynator + AsyncFixer/Meziantou (optional, requires .NET SDK) |

### C# linting (`dotnet/*`)

The C# lint pass shells out to the [`roslynator`](https://github.com/dotnet/roslynator) CLI and reports a curated subset of analyzer diagnostics, each prefixed `dotnet/`:

| Rule | What it catches |
|---|---|
| `dotnet/AsyncFixer01` | Unnecessary `async`/`await` (the await is the last statement) |
| `dotnet/AsyncFixer02` | Long-running or blocking operations inside an `async` method |
| `dotnet/AsyncFixer03` | Fire-and-forget `async void` — unhandled exceptions crash the process |
| `dotnet/MA0040` / `MA0042` / `MA0045` | Meziantou async/`Task` best practices (cancellation tokens, blocking calls) |
| `dotnet/CS0219` / `CS0162` | Unused variable / unreachable code (compiler diagnostics) |

This pass is **opt-in by environment**: it runs only when the .NET SDK and the `roslynator` global tool (`dotnet tool install -g roslynator.dotnet.cli`) are available and a `.csproj`/`.sln` is present. Otherwise it skips silently and returns nothing — exactly like the Python/Go lint wrappers. aislop bundles the AsyncFixer and Meziantou.Analyzer assemblies so these rules fire even on projects that don't reference them. Where Roslynator reports an accurate async finding, the approximate Phase-1 regex rule (`ai-slop/csharp-async-void` / `ai-slop/csharp-sync-over-async`) at the same line is suppressed so you never see both.

## Code Quality

Measures structural complexity, finds dead code, and detects unused dependencies.

| Rule | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `complexity/function-too-long` | Functions exceeding configurable line limit (default: 80). For Python, measured by logical body code: the signature, docstrings, comments, and blank lines do not count. `async def` and multi-line wrapped signatures are detected. |
| `complexity/file-too-large` | Files exceeding configurable line limit (default: 400) |
| `complexity/deep-nesting` | Control-flow nesting beyond threshold (default: 5) |
| `complexity/too-many-params` | Functions with too many parameters (default: 6). For Python, counts required parameters only: `self`/`cls`, `*args`/`**kwargs`, the `*` / `/` separators, and parameters with a default are not counted. |
| `code-quality/duplicate-block` | Repeated blocks of implementation code that should usually be extracted or shared |
| `code-quality/repeated-chained-call` | Repeated long call chains on the same receiver that should usually be cached or factored |
| `code-quality/unused-declaration` | Unused top-level declarations detected for safe removal |
| `knip/files` | Unused files not imported anywhere (JS/TS, fixable with `fix -f`) |
| `knip/exports`, `knip/types` | Unused exports and types (JS/TS) |
| `knip/dependencies` | Unused dependencies in package.json (fixable with `fix`) |
| `knip/devDependencies` | Unused devDependencies in package.json (fixable with `fix`) |
| `knip/unlisted` | Packages imported in code but missing from package.json |
| `knip/unresolved` | Imports that cannot be resolved |
| `knip/binaries` | Binaries used but not declared in package.json |
| `knip/duplicates` | Duplicate exports reported by knip |

## AI Slop

The rules that make aislop unique. These catch the patterns AI assistants leave behind.

| Rule | Severity | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-slop/trivial-comment` | warning | Comments restating the code (`// Import React`, `// Return the value`) |
| `ai-slop/narrative-comment` | warning | Decorative separators, phase/section headers, JSDoc preambles without meaningful tags (caught on top-level *and* interface/type members), cross-reference commentary, and longer prose blocks that carry an AI-narration signal (a restatement opener or step-by-step narration). Length alone is not flagged. |
| `ai-slop/swallowed-exception` | error | Empty catch blocks, catch blocks that only log (JS/TS/Python/Go/Ruby/Java/C#) |
| `ai-slop/silent-recovery` | warning | Catch blocks that log without including the caught error and then continue |
| `ai-slop/meta-comment` | warning | Comments about implementation phases, agent behavior, or generated-code process instead of the code itself |
| `ai-slop/redundant-try-catch` | warning | JS/TS catch blocks that only rethrow the same error without adding context, cleanup, or recovery |
| `ai-slop/redundant-type-coercion` | warning | TypeScript primitive parameters re-coerced with `String(...)`, `Number(...)`, or `Boolean(...)` |
| `ai-slop/duplicate-type-declaration` | warning | Exported TypeScript type/interface declarations repeated with the same name and shape across files |
| `ai-slop/thin-wrapper` | warning | Functions that only forward their own parameters unchanged to another function (a call that transforms its arguments is not flagged) |

| `ai-slop/unused-import` | warning | Unused imports (JS/TS and Python) |
| `ai-slop/console-leftover` | warning | `console.log`/`debug`/`info` left in production code |
| `ai-slop/todo-stub` | info | Unresolved, untracked TODO/FIXME/HACK comments (a TODO that links a tracking issue is spared) |
| `ai-slop/unreachable-code` | warning | Code after `return`/`throw` statements |
| `ai-slop/constant-condition` | warning | `if (true)`, `if (false)`, `if (0)` |

| `ai-slop/python-print-debug` | warning | Python `print(...)` debug output left in production modules |
| `ai-slop/python-range-len-loop` | info | Python `for i in range(len(items))` loops that usually want direct iteration or `enumerate()` |
| `ai-slop/python-chained-dict-get` | warning | Python `.get(..., {}).get(...)` fallback chains that hide missing-data cases |
| `ai-slop/python-repetitive-dispatch` | warning | Repeated Python equality branch ladders that should usually become a table/set/handler map |
| `ai-slop/python-isinstance-ladder` | warning | Repeated Python `isinstance(...)` ladders that should usually become a handler map or normalized representation |
| `ai-slop/go-library-panic` | warning | Go `panic(...)` calls in non-main library code unless clearly intentional |

| `ai-slop/csharp-sync-over-async` | warning | C# blocking on a Task via `.Result` / `.Wait()` / `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` (deadlock risk) |
| `ai-slop/csharp-suppressed-warning` | warning | C# `#pragma warning disable` / `[SuppressMessage]` without a justification comment |
| `ai-slop/csharp-empty-catch-rethrow` | warning | C# catch blocks that only rethrow without adding context, cleanup, or recovery |
| `ai-slop/csharp-null-forgiving` | warning | C# null-forgiving `!` operator silencing nullable warnings instead of handling null |
| `ai-slop/csharp-console-leftover` | warning | C# `Console.*` / `Debug.*` / `Trace.*` output left in library code |
| `ai-slop/csharp-broad-catch` | warning | C# `catch (Exception)` that catches everything (non-empty, non-rethrow) instead of the specific type(s) it can handle |
| `ai-slop/csharp-linq-count` | warning | C# `.Count() > 0` / `.Count() == 0` enumerating a whole sequence where `.Any()` short-circuits |
| `ai-slop/csharp-index-loop` | warning | C# index `for` loop over `.Length`/`.Count` that reads more clearly as `foreach` |

## Security

Finds secrets, risky constructs, and vulnerable dependencies.

| `security/shell-injection` | User input in command execution |
| `security/vulnerable-dependency` | npm/pip/cargo/go dependency audit |
| `security/dependency-audit-skipped` | Dependency audit could not run because tooling or lockfile context was missing |

## Architecture (opt-in)

Custom import and path rules defined in `.aislop/rules.yml`. Enable with `engines.architecture: true` in your config.

| Rule type | Example |
|---|---|
| `forbid_import` | Ban `axios` project-wide |
| `forbid_import_from_path` | Controllers cannot import database modules |
| `require_pattern` | Require error handling in API routes |

See [examples/architecture-rules.yml](../examples/architecture-rules.yml) for a sample rules file.
