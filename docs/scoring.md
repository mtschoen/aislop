# Scoring

aislop produces a single score from 0 to 100 for every scan.

## How it works

Every diagnostic contributes a weighted penalty based on its severity:

| Severity | Base penalty |
|---|---|
| Error | 3.0 |
| Warning | 1.0 |
| Info | 0.25 |

Penalties are multiplied by the engine weight (configurable in `.aislop/config.yml`).

By default, aislop now uses an **AI-slop-first** weighting profile:

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    format: 0.3
    lint: 0.6
    code-quality: 0.8
    ai-slop: 2.5
    architecture: 1.0
    security: 1.5
  smoothing: 20
```

This means AI-slop findings are weighted more heavily than generic lint/format noise,
while security still carries significant impact.

## Style findings count for half

Style and maintainability rules (`trivial-comment`, `narrative-comment`, `file-too-large`,
`function-too-long`) still surface as findings, but contribute half their normal weight to the
score. This keeps the number driven by genuine slop (swallowed errors, dead code, hallucinated
imports) rather than house style, without hiding the style findings themselves.

## Density normalization

The final score uses **logarithmic scaling with issue-density normalization**. Penalties are measured relative to the number of source files in the project, so:

- A few issues in a large codebase don't tank the score unfairly
- A single issue in an otherwise clean project stays proportional
- The score remains meaningful regardless of project size

## Score labels

| Score | Label |
|---|---|
| 75 -- 100 | Healthy |
| 50 -- 74 | Needs Work |
| 0 -- 49 | Critical |

These thresholds are configurable:

```yaml
scoring:
  thresholds:
    good: 75    # scores above this are "Healthy"
    ok: 50      # scores above this are "Needs Work", below is "Critical"
```

## Tuning guidance

- Increase `ai-slop` weight if you want strict AI-output hygiene.
- Increase `security` weight if dependency/runtime risk should dominate your score.
- Increase `smoothing` for large legacy codebases so a few warnings are less punitive.
- Lower `lint` and `code-quality` weights if you want scores to emphasize AI-specific findings.

## CI quality gate

Use `ci.failBelow` to fail CI when the score drops below a threshold:

```yaml
ci:
  failBelow: 70
```

`aislop ci` exits with code 1 when the score is below the threshold.
